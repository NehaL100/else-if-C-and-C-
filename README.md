# else-if-C-and-C Language
ELSEIF...ELSE control statement allows identifying if a certain condition is true, and executes a block of code if it is the case.
The ELSE clause, while following the "IF 2<3" statement, is associated with the "IF X<2" statement, because the "IF 2<3" statement has a PRINT statement on the same line.
